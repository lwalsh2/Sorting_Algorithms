# Sorting Algorithms
This is a Sorting Algorithm project that utilizes `c` to build different algorithms as examples.

## Dependencies:
    cmake
    invoke

## Building with Invoke
This project can be built with Python's Invoke module. Using `invoke build` will build the different projects. To run the tests for the sorting methods, use `invoke run` followed by the sorting method you wish to run, or `all` to run all of them.
